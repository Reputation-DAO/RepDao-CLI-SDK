## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability:

1. **Do not** open a public issue.
2. Email the core team at **security@reputationdao.org** with the details.
3. Include a clear description, reproduction steps, and the potential impact.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and provide a remediation timeline once triaged.

After a fix ships, we credit reporters (if desired) in the release notes.

Thank you for helping keep the Reputation DAO ecosystem safe!
