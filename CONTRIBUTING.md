# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving **repdao**! This document explains how the project is organised and the steps we follow when shipping changes.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork & clone** the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd repdao
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the TypeScript sources:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Development Workflow

- Make changes in `src/`. The compiled output in `dist/` is generated by the TypeScript compilerâ€”never edit the built files directly.
- Keep PRs focused. If you need to fix unrelated issues, open a new pull request.
- Run the automated checks before submitting:
  ```bash
  npm run check
  ```
  This executes both the type checker (`npm run lint`) and the smoke test suite (`npm run test`).
- Add or update tests alongside your changes whenever possible.

## Commit Style

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages (e.g. `feat: add returnCyclesToFactory CLI command`).
- Reference GitHub issues in the commit body when relevant (`Closes #123`).
- Keep commits logically grouped to make reviews easier.

## Documentation

- Update the README and JSDoc / comments if the public API changes.
- Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` under the **Unreleased** heading summarising the change.

## Releasing

Release steps are automated via npm scripts:

1. Bump the version in `package.json`.
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the release date & highlights.
3. Run the preflight checks:
   ```bash
   npm run check
   ```
4. Publish:
   ```bash
   npm publish
   ```

## Questions?

Open a discussion or file an issue on GitHub. We track bugs, feature requests, and questions in the issue tracker.

Thanks again for helping make Reputation DAO better! ðŸ’›
